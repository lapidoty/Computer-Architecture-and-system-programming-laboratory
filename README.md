# Compute Complex Roots
" In this assignment, you shall write a program in x86 assembly language, to
find a single root of a polynomial of
complex
coefficients.
This assignment shall require you to work with the x87 subsystem, the
SSE register set, arrays, and interfacing with the C standard library. The
x87 does not support
complex numbers
, so you will need to implement the
representation for complex numbers and the functions defined over them
using support for floating-point numbers in the x87 subsystem. "

# Arbitrary Precision Calculator for Big Numbers

" In this assignment you shall write a postfix-based calculator for integer arith-
metic, somewhat similar to the dc program on Unix/Linux (read over the man page for dc).
The program will be written in a combination of C and x86/64-bit assembly language.
This version works with arbitrary-precision integers, providing functionality similar to that of bignums in Scheme, int in Python,
or LargeInteger in Java.
Your calculator will implement the following functionality:
•
Addition
•
Subtraction
•
Multiplication
•
Division "
